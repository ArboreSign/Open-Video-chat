# Open Video Chat

Open Video Chat is an open source video conferencing activity for the XO laptop. This project was originally started in March 2010 with funding from the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in Rochester NY, and continues with RIT HFOSS course and Google Summer of Code in 2013.


## Focus

The original focus was to use GStreamer to provide acceptable frame rates for sign language communication (estimated somewhere between 20 and 30).

Current GSoC 2013 objectives are to get it running again on Sugar and porting a pure Gtk3 implementation for cross-platform compatibility.


## Current Features & Status

- Sugar3/Gtk3 Interface
- text chat system on Telepathy channels
- Incomplete GStreamer 1.0 & RTP upgrades


## Planned Features

- Upwards of 30 frames per second
- Cross Platform Gtk3
- Audio
- Higher Resolution or Scaling
- Multi-User Implementation
